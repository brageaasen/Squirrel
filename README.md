# First personal Unity project [Squirrel]

# Description
This short game was created during the christmas break of H2022 (uploaded to git and slightly modified H2023).
This project was meant to be a short learning project to familiarize myself with the Unity program, and the C# language.
In [Squirrel], you have to collect nuts, and traverse through the forest to reunite with your other animal-friends.
